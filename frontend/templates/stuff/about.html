    <section class="mb-12 text-lg leading-relaxed">
      <p>
        Hello! I’m Andres Jaimes, an IT major at FIU with a passion for system administration and DevOps.  
        I love working behind the scenes to configure infrastructure, automate workflows, and build robust backend solutions.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
      Although I've been studying technology for just over a year and a few months, I’ve quickly developed a strong foundation in Linux server management, 
      containerization with Docker, and cloud service integration. I’m passionate about solving complex challenges that combine coding, networking, and security. Each day, I strive to deepen my knowledge and expand my skillset to become a well-rounded IT professional and DevOps engineer.
      </p>
      
      <p class="mt-4">
        This entire website is hosted on a Raspberry Pi that I personally configured — proof of my hands-on experience managing real-world systems.  
        I'm always eager to learn new technologies and improve my craft, especially when it comes to scalable, secure backend systems.
