I want to do this step by step:
- Considering I dont want to rely on live server I want to start by setting up the nginx config file with Docker
    - The goal is to have (2 images) (backend + flask) + (frontend static stuff + nignx config)
        - Step 1: find nginx image in dockerhub: 'docker search nginx'
            - nginx:alphine is the lightest that's why we picked it, fast and no bloating whatsoever

        - Step 2: config the config file
            -
